# Jaypie Core 🐦‍⬛🥧

Utility package with constants, errors, functions and logging

## 🐦‍⬛ Introduction

Jaypie is an opinionated approach to application development centered around JavaScript and the JSON:API specification in an event-driven architecture

Beyond that Jaypie core tries to stay neutral. Jaypie libraries such as `@jaypie/express` build off of this core into specific ecosystems

In an ideal world the bird would be looking at the pie
