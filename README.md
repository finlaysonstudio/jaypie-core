# Init Zero - Library Template 🏫👥

## ✏️ Repository Naming Conventions

* `SPONSOR-PROJECT` most deliverable projects, even if the GitHub organization is `SPONSOR`. I.e., `company-PROJECT`
* `hello-` simple demonstrations of a single technology
* `lib-` libraries, even internal, if they are general purpose
* `sandbox-` experiments or `poc-` proof of concept, a sandbox you want to preserve
* `template-` blueprints for future projects
* `toy-` educational projects
