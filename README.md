# Jaypie Core 🐦‍⬛🥧

Utility package with constants, errors, functions and logging

## 🐦‍⬛ Introduction

Jaypie is an opinionated approach to application development centered around JavaScript and the JSON:API specification in an event-driven architecture

Beyond that Jaypie core tries to stay neutral. Jaypie libraries such as `@jaypie/express` build off of this core into specific ecosystems

In an ideal world the bird would be looking at the pie

## 📋 Usage

### Installation

```bash
npm install @jaypie/core
```

See [Jaypie documentation](https://github.com/finlaysonstudio/jaypie) for usage.
